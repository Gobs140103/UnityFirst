For achieving the highest accuracy in OCR, you might consider using advanced, state-of-the-art models and frameworks beyond the standard pip-installable libraries. Some of the most powerful OCR tools currently include Google Vision API, AWS Textract, and Microsoft Azure OCR. However, if you want to stick with pip-installable libraries, you can explore models like PaddleOCR or advanced deep learning-based solutions such as using CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) with pre-trained weights.

### Using PaddleOCR

PaddleOCR is a powerful and efficient OCR tool developed by Baidu. It supports multilingual text recognition and provides higher accuracy for various OCR tasks.

#### Installation

Install PaddleOCR and PaddlePaddle:

```bash
pip install paddlepaddle paddleocr
```

#### Usage

Here's how to use PaddleOCR:

```python
from paddleocr import PaddleOCR, draw_ocr
import cv2
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def perform_paddleocr(image_path):
    ocr = PaddleOCR(use_angle_cls=True, lang='en')
    result = ocr.ocr(image_path, cls=True)

    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    boxes = [line[0] for line in result[0]]
    txts = [line[1][0] for line in result[0]]
    scores = [line[1][1] for line in result[0]]

    for (box, text, score) in zip(boxes, txts, scores):
        print(f'Text: {text}, Score: {score}')

    # Draw results
    image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    im_show = draw_ocr(image, boxes, txts, scores, font_path='path_to_your_font.ttf')
    plt.imshow(im_show)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
perform_paddleocr(image_path)
```

### Advanced Deep Learning Models

For more custom and potentially higher accuracy solutions, you can build an OCR system using deep learning models like CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) or Transformer-based models.

#### Using a Pre-trained CRNN Model

You can use a pre-trained CRNN model available in the `deep-text-recognition-benchmark` repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark
cd deep-text-recognition-benchmark
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Download Pre-trained Model**

```bash
# Assuming you are in the cloned repository's directory
wget https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark/releases/download/1.0/best_accuracy.pth
```

3. **Inference Script**

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import string
import argparse
import json

# Define the character set
characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

# Define the transformation
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((32, 100)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
])

# Load the pre-trained model
model_path = 'best_accuracy.pth'
model = torch.load(model_path)
model.eval()

def recognize_text(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
    image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)

    with torch.no_grad():
        preds = model(image)

    _, preds_index = preds.max(2)
    preds_str = ''.join([characters[i] for i in preds_index])
    print(f'Recognized Text: {preds_str}')

image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
recognize_text(image_path)
```

### Summary

For the highest accuracy in OCR:
1. **PaddleOCR**: An efficient and accurate OCR tool.
2. **Advanced Deep Learning Models**: Using pre-trained CRNN models or Transformer-based models.

By leveraging these powerful tools, you can significantly improve the accuracy of your OCR system.
